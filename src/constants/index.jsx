Engineers focused on solving technical problems, while designers were concerned with aesthetics and user experience. However, as products become more complex and user-centered, the need for a unified approach has grown. Design engineering bridges this gap by combining the precision of engineering with the creativity of design. Itâs where form meets function, ensuring that products are not only technically sound but also intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly.",

Whether itâs a smartphone, a medical device, or an automotive system, todayâs products are expected to be intuitive, responsive, and aligned with user needs. Design engineers play a pivotal role in this transformation by focusing on the end-user from the very beginning of the development process. Instead of approaching design and engineering as separate stages, they merge them into a cohesive workflow that considers usability, ergonomics, and aesthetics alongside structural integrity and functionality.",
